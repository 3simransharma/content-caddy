# Content Caddy

Content Caddy is the ultimate browser extension that allows you to save, organize, and share sections of web content easily. With Content Caddy, you can capture important information, keep track of references, and share your findings with colleagues and friends on your favorite social media platforms.

This extension was built using the latest TypeScript and React technology, and it offers a highly intuitive and user-friendly interface that anyone can use, regardless of their level of technical expertise.

## How it works

Content Caddy lets you save text sections, and in the future images and other multimedia elements from web pages. It also comes with a range of customization options that allow you to personalize the way you save and access content, highlight text, and more.

Content Caddy helps you understand the content you've saved, making it easier for you to find and recall specific information at a later time.

## Getting Started

Although Content Caddy extension is not yet published, you can still use it in your browser. Getting started with this extension is a breeze! Just follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run `yarn install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `yarn dev` to start the development server. This will compile the extension with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) enabled and start a server to reload the extension automatically.
4. Open your browser and go to the Extensions page. (In Chrome, go to `chrome://extensions/`.)
5. Enable Developer Mode in the top right corner if it's not already enabled.
6. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `dist` folder in the project directory.
7. The extension should now be installed and ready to use.

Note: If you make any changes to the code, the extension will automatically reload thanks to HMR.

## Building

To build the extension, run `yarn build`. This will compile the TypeScript files and bundle them with Vite.

## Testing

To run tests, run `yarn test`. This will run all tests using Jest.
